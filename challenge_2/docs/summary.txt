Project Summary: Heat Shield Component for High-Temperature Applications

The aluminum alloy used in the shield is rated up to 100°C under continuous load,
and up to 120°C under short-duration peaks. The design incorporates multiple cooling fins
to improve thermal dissipation and reduce material fatigue. Weight efficiency was prioritized,
resulting in a 25% reduction from the previous version.

Key takeaways:
- Max operating temp: 100°C
- Thermal peak tolerance: 120°C (short-term)
- Material: Aluminum Alloy 6061-T6
- Use case: Aerospace, automotive, high-stress enclosures

Recommendations:
- Do not exceed 100°C for sustained use.
- For environments > 100°C, consider alternative materials like Inconel or stainless steel.
